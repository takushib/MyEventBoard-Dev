# MyEventBoard

MyEventBoard is a scheduling web application currently being developed by Tommy Liao, Simon Louie and Blaise Takushi,  
as part of the Schedule It! project.

## Accessing the Application

## Setting Up the Repository for Development

For the project to be functional, it should be cloned into the 'public_html' folder in your engineering filespace.  
There are a few things to install. Run the Bash shell scripts to install Composer and some packages (Twig and phpCAS).  
Install Composer first, and then install the packages.

Remember to also set permissions for everything inside the repository.  
While inside the 'public_html' folder, run the script named 'set_permissions.sh'.
