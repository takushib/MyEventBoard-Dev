# Front End User Interface Styling Files

This folder contains all the files responsible for the styling of the front end user interface. 
The front end styling uses Cascading Style Sheets to style each of it's pages on the web application. 
Styles are split into its own file to help organize which CSS applies to which page. 
Some css files are used throughout multiple HTML files because those elements persists throughout the web application. 
In general, if an element doesn't persist throughout the web application, it should have it's own css file.
