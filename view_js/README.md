# Front End Javascript Files

This folder contains all the files responsible for the front end functionality (javascript code) of MyEventBoard. Each javascript files are seperated by which page they are responsible for. However, there are a few exceptions to this. This exception was made to minimize the size of files sizes and reuse code whenever it is possible. The Javascript files uses a mixture of pure javascript and JQuery. It would probably be better to be consistent and use one or the other. This problems is more prevalent during the earlier stages (create page, register page) of development in which JQuery wasn't being used yet. This problem should be fixed via refactoring.

## Main Page:
- main.js 

## Create Page: 
- create.js

## Manage Page:

- reservationsEventView.js (this is for viewing an individual reservation)

## Register Page:

## Edit Page:
